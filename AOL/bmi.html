    <p class="desc">The Body Mass Index (BMI) is one way to measure body size. It's a tool to estimate
        body fat and screen for obesity and health risks. It can be calculated
        with a BMI calculator and classifies people as being underweight, overweight, and obese
        based on their height and weight.</p>

                You can use our online BMI calculator by entering your weight
                in kilograms and height in meters. Once you've
                calculated your BMI, refer to the corresponding
                categories to assess your health risks.

                BMI is an effective tool for evaluating your potential risk for diseases associated
                with excess body fat. Both overweight and obesity significantly elevate the risks
                of mortality and various health issues. Generally, the higher your BMI,
                the higher the likelihood of developing
                chronic conditions related to obesity, such as:
            </p>

            <p>
                BMI provides a straightforward and quantifiable measure of body mass,
                yet it's not always precise across all demographics. It can be particularly
                inaccurate for older adults, athletes, very tall or short individuals, and
                those with muscular builds, such as bodybuilders.
                These groups might have higher BMIs due to greater muscle mass.
            </p>

            <p>
                Further limitations of BMI include:
            </p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>It does not account for genetic factors that could predispose someone to obesity-related
                    conditions like metabolic syndrome.</li>
                <li>It overlooks environmental and lifestyle influences that may also impact chronic disease
                    risk. </li>
                <li>It does not consider how body fat is distributed, which can vary significantly among
                    individuals.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It's crucial to understand that having obesity does not automatically
                imply poor health, just as being within a 'normal' weight range doesn’t
                guarantee good health. BMI should not be seen as a definitive marker of your health status
                but rather as one tool to help guide health decisions.
            </p>

            <p>Regardless of your BMI, maintaining a healthy diet and lifestyle is universally recommended.
                Discuss your BMI and overall health with your healthcare provider to determine the best course
                of action for you.
